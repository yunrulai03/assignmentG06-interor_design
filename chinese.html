            <p>In traditional Chinese style interior design, the master bedroom is often the most important room in the home, 
                as it is believed to represent the overall well-being and success of the household. The furniture used in the master 
                bedroom is carefully chosen to promote a sense of calm, balance, and harmony while also incorporating the principles 
                of Feng Shui and Wu Xing. </p>
            <p>One of the most important pieces of furniture in the master bedroom is the bed. In Feng Shui principles, the bed should 
                be positioned in a way that allows for a clear view of the door and ample space around the bed for good energy flow. 
                The bed should also have a solid headboard, which is believed to provide support and stability in one's life. 
                Traditional Chinese style beds are often made from natural materials such as wood, and may be decorated with carvings or 
                other intricate designs. </p>
            <p>Another important piece of furniture in the master bedroom is the wardrobe or closet. In traditional Chinese style, the 
                wardrobe is often made from natural materials and is designed to provide ample storage space while also fitting seamlessly 
                into the overall design of the room. In Feng Shui principles, it is recommended to keep the closet organized and clutter-
                free to promote good energy flow. </p>
            <p>Additionally, traditional Chinese style master bedrooms often include seating areas, such as a pair of armchairs or a 
                small sofa. These areas are designed for relaxation and conversation, and can be used for reading or enjoying a cup of tea. 
                In Feng Shui principles, it is recommended to have a clear view of the door from the seating area to promote a sense of 
                security and well-being. </p>
            <p>In terms of the five elements of Wu Xing, wood and earth are commonly used in traditional Chinese style interior design for 
                the master bedroom. The use of natural materials such as wood and bamboo is believed to promote a sense of calm and balance 
                in the space, while earthy tones such as beige and brown can promote grounding and stability. </p>
            <p>The furniture used in traditional Chinese style master bedroom design is carefully chosen to promote a sense of calm, balance, 
                and harmony while also incorporating the principles of Feng Shui and Wu Xing. By using natural materials, muted colors, and 
                careful placement of furniture, you can create a space that promotes restful sleep, relaxation, and overall well-being. </p>

            <p>Early 20th century kitchen cabinet. Kitchen cabinets were an important part of the traditional Chinese home. Dishes 
                prepared by the family cook would be placed in the cabinet ahead of being served. Anything left over could be returned 
                to the cabinet. The doors have open lattice in the form of a long life motif with a calligraphy medallion. The freely 
                sliding lattice panels on the lower section were used for stacking freshly washed cookware. </p>
            <p>The kitchen is by far the place we spend the most time in our homes. Whether the heart of the family home, the home cook’s 
                getaway, or the room at a party where everyone always gathers, we all want a great kitchen! Be it in a big family home or 
                a cozy loft apartment, our kitchen is our oasis. </p>

                    layout of the kitchen work with your space; for example, L-shaped, U-shaped, parallel, or surrounding an island. If your 
                    kitchen is small, as can be the case with Chinese kitchens in the city, you can consider draws, freestanding cabinets or 
                    wall-hung cupboards and units for great storage space saving solutions. </li>
