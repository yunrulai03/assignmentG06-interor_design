            <h4><em> ‘Japan has a unique style of interior design that is characterized by its simplicity, 
                minimalism, and natural beauty. It is focused on creating a peaceful and calming atmosphere, 
                promoting a sense of harmony and balance in the space’ </span></em>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>Japanese architecture and interior design has a strong focus on the natural world, often emphasizing organic materials, 
                colours, designs and forms. Japanese design has a similar aesthetic to minimalism with its neutral colour palate and 
                commitment to cleanliness. Japanese architecture and design is recognizable for its simplicity and clean lines. 
                One of the most iconic examples of Japanese architecture is the Moriyama House in Tokyo, 
                which is celebrated as the epitome of community-focused design from inside to outside. </p>

        </div>
        <div style="color: #453F3F;">
            <p>The focus is on creating a space that is both inviting and calming. Natural materials like wood and bamboo 
                are used extensively, along with neutral colors and clean lines, to create a peaceful atmosphere. 
                Furniture is typically low to the ground, like a tatami mat or floor cushions, which promotes a sense of 
                relaxation and intimacy.</p>  

            <p>Shoji screens, sliding paper screens that provide privacy while allowing natural light to filter into the room, 
                are a common feature in Japanese living rooms. These screens can be used to divide the space into smaller, 
                more intimate areas or to create a sense of openness and flow. </p> 
                
            <p>Decorative elements are kept to a minimum, with a few carefully chosen pieces of art or nature-inspired decor, 
                like a simple vase of flowers or a bonsai tree, adding a touch of beauty and tranquility to the space. </p> 

            <p>Japanese inspired living room interior design creates a space that is both practical and aesthetically pleasing, 
                promoting relaxation and mindfulness in daily life.</p>
